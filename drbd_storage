DRBDÂ® (Distributed Replicated Block Device) refers to block devices designed as a building block to form high availability (HA) clusters. This is done by mirroring a whole block device via an assigned network. DRBD can be understood as network based raid-1.

-----------------------------------------------
Main features of the integration in Proxmox VE
-----------------------------------------------

- LVM on top of DRBD (Primary/Primary

- All VM disks (LVM volumes on the DRBD device) can be replicated in real time on both Proxmox VE nodes via the network. Alternatively, all VM storage can be replicated in nearly real time to many other backup servers.

- Ability to live migrate running machines without downtime in a few seconds WITHOUT the need of SAN (iSCSI, FC, NFS) as the data is already on both nodes.

 Note
------

In Proxmox 1.x only KVM guests can use the new Storage Model. In Proxmox 2.0 with a little command line work you can use OpenVZ on DRBD too.
